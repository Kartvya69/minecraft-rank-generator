Minecraft Rank Generator
A powerful and easy-to-use tool to generate custom rank configurations for your Minecraft server, streamlining the process of setting up your in-game hierarchy.
This repository is a fork of the original ItemsAdder/minecraft-rank-generator project. We aim to maintain and enhance this valuable tool for the broader Minecraft server community.
‚ú® Features
 * Effortless Rank Creation: Quickly generate the necessary configuration files for various Minecraft server rank plugins.
 * Highly Customizable: Easily define rank names, prefixes, suffixes, permissions, and other properties to perfectly match your server's style and needs.
 * Time-Saving Workflow: Automate the tedious manual creation of rank configurations, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your server.
 * User-Friendly Interface: (Assuming your project has one, if it's a web app) An intuitive interface makes rank generation straightforward for server owners of all experience levels.
